appelpy: Example notebooks

About üëÅÔ∏è
=====================
`appelpy <https://github.com/mfarragher/appelpy>`_ is the *Applied Econometrics Library for Python*.  It seeks to bridge the gap between the software options that have a simple syntax (such as Stata) and other powerful options that use Python's object-oriented programming as part of data modelling workflows.  ‚öóÔ∏è

The **appelpy-examples** repository contains notebooks that demonstrate some of the functions of appelpy applied to econometric datasets.  Some output is compared to the results of other software (e.g. Stata) where possible.

Econometric modelling and general regression analysis in Python have never been easier!

The library builds upon the functionality of the 'vanilla' Python data stack (e.g. Pandas, Numpy, etc.) and other libraries such as Statsmodels.


Note
=====================
As more features and functionality are added, more notebooks will be pushed to this repo.

The aim is to have notebooks numbered sequentially (the notebooks with most general and basic features are first in sequence).
